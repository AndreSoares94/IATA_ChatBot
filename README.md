# Inteligência Ambiente: Tecnologias e Aplicações - Chatbot
University Project for Ambient Intelligence: Technologies and Applications in Java - course of Computer Engineering at University of Minho.

## So, what is this?
This project is the second subject of IATA where we focus on developing a chatbot that communicates through sockets with the user and the bot detects the emotion in the user input by analising the words, keys pressed and time used and answers accordingly.
It was made with help of an AIML library.
